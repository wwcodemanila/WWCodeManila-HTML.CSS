    UPDATE THIS:

    Populate your contents with the contents for your study group's topic

    Put the files under contents/ and reference them here.
    Use descriptive topic titles, intead of "Topic 1", "Topic 2".

    For example:

    - [Variables and Constants](contents/variables_and_constants.md)

    You can also opt to change the contents structure, especially if your study groups has many topic groupings. For example:

    - Ruby Fundamentals
      - [Variables and Constants](ruby_fundamentals/variables_and_constants.md)
      ...

    UPDATE THIS:

    Aside from references, you can add other useful topics here, e.g. coding conventions, best practices, etc

    Just create a markdown file under resources and reference it here. For example:
