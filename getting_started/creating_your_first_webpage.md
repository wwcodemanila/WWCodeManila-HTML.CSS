## What are HTML &amp; CSS?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the 
content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage.

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
