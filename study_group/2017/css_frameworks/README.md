## CSS Frameworks

> A CSS framework is a pre-prepared software framework that is meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and unobtrusive.

### Why use CSS Frameworks?
1.  Saves you time in styling.     
You don't have to do all the styling anymore. Just add the available classes or styles in your markup and you're good to go. But it is always important to know CSS basics to have an idea of what is happening or if you need to customize.

2. Mobile ready.   
Most CSS Frameworks, if not all, are built with reusability and responsiveness in mind. 

3. Gives grid layout classes.   
Layouting is one of challenging frontend task to make, having a list of classes available for you to use is one of the key factors in choosing a framework. 

4. Optimize rendering of webpage.   
CSS used are structured properly making sure that rendering or display time doesn't take to much resource such as time and memory.

5. Utilies available    
Some CSS frameworks also provide utilies such as helper classes ex. text-capitalize, text-center, align-left, etc., modals, date picker, slider, accordion.

> Note: It is also important  to consider when choosing a framework to use if the project is  `active`  and  `stable`.
